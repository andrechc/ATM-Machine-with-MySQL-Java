# ATM-Machine-with-MySQL-Java
Project that I made with Java &amp; MySQL to emulate the backend of an ATM machine.

The project works when attached to an mySQL table, which keeps track of the users info, including their total funds.
In the main file, it allows you to either create a new user or to login to an already existing user. Transactions between different users are possible.
